	abstract = {Soils are a major source of nitrogen oxides, which in the atmosphere help govern its oxidative capacity. Thus the response of soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions to forcings such as warming or forest loss has a meaningful impact on global atmospheric chemistry. We find that the soil emission rate of NO in Amazonia from a common inventory is biased low by at least an order of magnitude in comparison to tower-based observations. Accounting for this regional bias decreases the modeled global methane lifetime by 1.4\%–2.6\%. In comparison, a fully deforested Amazonia, representing a 37\% decrease in global emissions of isoprene, decreases methane lifetime by at most 4.6\%, highlighting the sensitive response of oxidation rates to changes in emissions of NO compared to those of terpenes. Our results demonstrate that improving our understanding of soil NO emissions will yield a more accurate representation of atmospheric oxidative capacity.},
