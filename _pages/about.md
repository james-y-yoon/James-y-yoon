Hi there! I'm a second-year graduate student at the [Department of Atmospheric & Climate Science](https://atmos.uw.edu), University of Washington. 

**I am an atmospheric chemistry modeler who mainly uses satellite and ground-based remote sensing observations.** I'm broadly interested in how the biosphere affects atmospheric composition and the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. I'm also interested in science communication, especially via digital media.

Outside of science, I'm a photographer and musician -- I hope to be a street musician in Times Square one day!
