Hi there! I'm a third-year graduate student at the [Department of Atmospheric & Climate Science](https://atmos.uw.edu), University of Washington-Seattle. 

**I am an atmospheric chemistry modeler who mainly uses satellite and ground-based remote sensing observations.** I'm broadly interested in how the biosphere affects atmospheric composition and the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. I'm also interested in science communication, especially via digital media.

Outside of science, I'm an aspiring musician -- I hope to be a street performer in Times Square one day!
